ChEEQ is an open-source computational tool for the user-friendly analysis of quantitative data acquired from length measurements of developing chicken embryos. It is implemented in Pyton code on the Google Colab platform, allowing the user to run it without any local installation. To to use the tool, go to the link:

https://nbviewer.org/github/pjmartel/ChEEQ_tool/blob/main/ChEEQ.ipynb

and click on "Open in Colab".

Follow the instructions on the tool's notebook, and an Excel workbook containing the data will be loaded for analisys. 

To compare your own data againts the reference data on the Workbook, you must download the notebook file "ChEEQ_inputData.xlsx" by clicking on the following link:

https://github.com/pjmartel/ChEEQ_tool/raw/refs/heads/main/ChEEQ_inputData.xlsx

and then, on the worksheets "Experiments_SingleObservations" (for isolated observations) or "Experiments_ObservationsOverTim",(for timelapse observations), replace the data therein with your own measurements.
